                    </p>I was born in Izmir in the late 1980s and lived here until I was
                    7
                    years old, and then I moved to Cyprus with my family.From that day until today, my whole life
                    has
                    been spent in Cyprus. I
                    have lived my life with graphic design and music until today, but at the age of 33 I decided to
                    become a software developer.
                    Everything that is seen is a part of this journey.</p>

                    </p> I started playing drums at the age of 16 out of pure interest in 
                    pots and buckets at home. I have brought my level to a certain point with the 
                    courses I have followed online over time and I have been taking the stage actively 
                    for 14 years. After performing with various musicians in Cyprus, I've been playing 
                    with Dilara Ferit for the last 4 years.

                    </p>After completing my graphic design education that I started in 2005 in 2010, I 
                    took a position as a Graphic Designer in various companies in Izmir and Cyprus. 
                    I have been working at Major Music Center for the last 10 years. I want 
                    to combine my profession with web design and improve myself.
